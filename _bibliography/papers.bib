  abstract   = {The past 2 years, during which waves of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants swept the globe, have starkly highlighted health disparities across nations. Tegally et al. show how the coordinated efforts of talented African scientists have in a short time made great contributions to pandemic surveillance and data gathering. Their efforts and initiatives have provided early warning that has likely benefited wealthier countries more than their own. Genomic surveillance identified the emergence of the highly transmissible Beta and Omicron variants and now the appearance of Omicron sublineages in Africa. However, it is imperative that technology transfer for diagnostics and vaccines, as well the logistic wherewithal to produce and deploy them, match the data-gathering effort.},

These regions often grapple with limited healthcare resources and access to advanced diagnostic tools. Consequently, there is a pressing need for innovative approaches that can enhance AMR surveillance and management. Machine learning (ML) though underutilized in these settings, presents a promising avenue. This study leverages ML models trained on whole-genome sequencing data from England, where such data is more readily available, to predict AMR in E. coli, targeting key antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin, ampicillin, and cefotaxime. A crucial part of our work involved the validation of these models using an independent dataset from Africa, specifically from Uganda, Nigeria, and Tanzania, to ascertain their applicability and effectiveness in LMICs.},

 abstract    = {The advent of metagenomics has dramatically expanded our understanding of microbial communities, particularly through the study of wastewater, which serves as a rich source of microbial data. In Africa, wastewater metagenomics presents unparalleled opportunities for public health monitoring, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) tracking, and the discovery of new microbial species and functions. Utilizing high-throughput sequencing (HTS) technologies, this method allows for direct analysis of nucleic acids from wastewater samples, providing a cost-effective and comprehensive approach for pathogen surveillance. The potential of wastewater metagenomics in Africa is vast. It can revolutionize public health monitoring by acting as an early warning system for infectious disease outbreaks, offering near real-time data to shape effective responses. This is especially critical in densely populated urban areas with poor sanitation, where the risk of disease spread is high. Moreover, this approach enables the detection of emerging pathogens and insights into environmental health. However, the implementation of wastewater metagenomics in Africa faces several challenges. These include variability in wastewater composition due to differing local customs, limited infrastructure for sequencing and data analysis, and a shortage of bioinformatics expertise. Socio-political and ethical issues also complicate data sharing and the equitable distribution of benefits. To overcome these challenges, there is a need to enhance capacity through collaborative training, infrastructural development, and international partnerships. Investing and sustaining local genomics and bioinformatics infrastructure and expertise is crucial. Moreover, establishing robust data governance frameworks and engaging communities are essential for leveraging metagenomics to advance scientific knowledge and deliver tangible health and economic benefits. With strategic planning and collaboration, Africa can harness the transformative potential of wastewater metagenomics to improve disease surveillance, combat AMR, and foster scientific innovation, contributing significantly to sustainable development and improved quality of life.},

  abstract   = {Rationale: Airborne transmission of Mycobacterium tuberculosis results from incompletely characterized host, bacterial, and environmental factors. Sputum smear microscopy is associated with considerable variability in transmission. Objectives: To evaluate the use of cough-generated aerosols of M. tuberculosis to predict recent transmission. Methods: Patients with pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) underwent a standard evaluation and collection of cough aerosol cultures of M. tuberculosis. We assessed household contacts for new M. tuberculosis infection. We used multivariable logistic regression analysis with cluster adjustment to analyze predictors of new infection. Measurements and main results: From May 2009 to January 2011, we enrolled 96 sputum culture-positive index TB cases and their 442 contacts. Only 43 (45%) patients with TB yielded M. tuberculosis in aerosols. Contacts of patients with TB who produced high aerosols (≥10 CFU) were more likely to have a new infection compared with contacts from low-aerosol (1-9 CFU) and aerosol-negative cases (69%, 25%, and 30%, respectively; P = 0.009). A high-aerosol patient with TB was the only predictor of new M. tuberculosis infection in unadjusted (odds ratio, 5.18; 95% confidence interval, 1.52-17.61) and adjusted analyses (odds ratio, 4.81; 95% confidence interval, 1.20-19.23). Contacts of patients with TB with no aerosols versus low and high aerosols had differential tuberculin skin test and interferon-γ release assay responses. Conclusions: Cough aerosols of M. tuberculosis are produced by a minority of patients with TB but predict transmission better than sputum smear microscopy or culture. Cough aerosols may help identify the most infectious patients with TB and thus improve the cost-effectiveness of TB control programs..},

  abstract   = {The recent re-emergence of multidrug-resistant pathogens has exacerbated their threat to worldwide public health. The evolution of the genomics era has led to the generation of huge volumes of sequencing data at an unprecedented rate due to the ever-reducing costs of whole-genome sequencing (WGS). We have developed the Rapid Microbial Analysis Pipeline (rMAP), a user-friendly pipeline capable of profiling the resistomes of ESKAPE pathogens ( Enterococcus faecium , Staphylococcus aureus , Klebsiella pneumoniae , Acinetobacter baumannii , Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter species) using WGS data generated from Illumina’s sequencing platforms. rMAP is designed for individuals with little bioinformatics expertise, and automates the steps required for WGS analysis directly from the raw genomic sequence data, including adapter and low-quality sequence read trimming, de novo genome assembly, genome annotation, single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variant calling, phylogenetic inference by maximum likelihood, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) profiling, plasmid profiling, virulence factor determination, multi-locus sequence typing (MLST), pangenome analysis and insertion sequence characterization (IS). Once the analysis is finished, rMAP generates an interactive web-like html report. rMAP installation is very simple, it can be run using very simple commands. It represents a rapid and easy way to perform comprehensive bacterial WGS analysis using a personal laptop in low-income settings where high-performance computing infrastructure is limited.},

  abstract   = {Childhood HBV immunization remains globally fundamental to the elimination of hepatitis B virus (HBV). However, monitoring proportions of HBV vaccine seroprotection and their determinants among African Pediatric recipients is crucial. This study sought to verify extent of immune protection accorded by the HBV vaccine in African children of up to 17 years of age by pooling the prevalence of seroprotection reported by primary studies conducted in the Northern, Western, and Southern African regions. We included 19 eligible articles out of the 197 initially downloaded, published from 1999 to 2021 from African Journals Online (AJOL), EMBASE, Scopus, and PubMed. The study protocol was registered with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO), University of York Centre for Reviews and Dissemination, under the registration number CRD42022361277. Significantly higher (p < 0.0001) proportion of HBV vaccine seroprotection (69.07%) was found among children under 15 years of age than children 15–17 years (32.368%), 95% CI [34.2454–39.0847%]. Whereas successful integration of the HBV vaccine on the extended programs on immunizations (EPI) has been a major achievement in the reduction of HBV infection in Africa, markedly reduced HBV vaccine seroprotection is persistently demonstrated among adolescent children 15–17 years of age. Future studies are required to clarify the need for booster dose vaccination in most at risk populations and age groups.},

Prevalences of most mutations differed from those seen in Ugandans attending health centers near the refugee centers.

  abstract   = {Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a leading cause of nosocomial infections worldwide. It can produce a range of debilitating infections, have a propensity for developing antimicrobial resistance, and present with a variety of potent virulence factors. This study investigated the sequence types (ST), phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility profiles, and resistance and virulence genes among clinical isolates from urinary tract and skin and soft tissue infections. Fifty-six P. aeruginosa clinical isolates were obtained from six medical centers across five counties in Kenya between 2015 and 2020. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was performed to conduct genomic characterization, sequence typing, and phylogenetic analysis of the isolates. Results showed the presence of globally distributed high-risk clones (ST244 and ST357), local high-risk clones (ST2025, ST455, and ST233), and a novel multidrug-resistant (MDR) clone carrying virulence genes (ST3674). Furthermore, 31% of the study isolates were found to be MDR with phenotypic resistance to a variety of antibiotics, including piperacillin (79%), ticarcillin-clavulanic acid (57%), meropenem (34%), levofloxacin (70%), and cefepime (32%). Several resistance genes were identified, including carbapenemases VIM-6 (ST1203) and NDM-1 (ST357), fluoroquinolone genes, crpP, and qnrVCi, while 14 and 22 different chromosomal mutations were detected in the gyrA and parC genes, respectively. All isolates contained at least three virulence genes. Among the virulence genes identified, phzB1 was the most abundant (50/56, 89%). About 21% (12/56) of the isolates had the exoU+/exoS- genotype, while 73% (41/56) of the isolates had the exoS+/exoU- genotype. This study also discovered 12 novel lineages of P. aeruginosa, of which one (ST3674) demonstrated both extensive antimicrobial resistance and the highest number of virulence genes (236/242, 98%). Although most high-risk clones were detected in Nairobi County, high-risk and clones of interest were found throughout the country, indicating the local spread of global epidemic clones and the emergence of new strains. Thus, this study illustrates the urgent need for coordinated local, regional, and international antimicrobial resistance surveillance efforts.},

The Sensititre MYCOTB MIC plate (MYCOTB) is a microtiter plate containing lyophilized antibiotics and configured for determination of MICs to first- and second-line antituberculosis drugs. To evaluate the performance of MYCOTB for M. tuberculosis drug susceptibility testing using the Middlebrook 7H10 agar proportion method (APM) as the comparator, we conducted a two-site study using archived M. tuberculosis isolates from Uganda and the Republic of Korea. Thawed isolates were subcultured, and dilutions were inoculated into MYCOTB wells and onto 7H10 agar. MYCOTB results were read at days 7, 10, 14, and 21; APM results were read at 21 days. A total of 222 isolates provided results on both platforms. By APM, 106/222 (47.7%) of isolates were resistant to at least isoniazid and rifampin. Agreement between MYCOTB and APM with respect to susceptibility or resistance was ≥92% for 7 of 12 drugs when a strict definition was used and ≥96% for 10 of 12 drugs when agreement was defined by allowing a ± one-well range of dilutions around the APM critical concentration. For ethambutol, agreement was 80% to 81%. For moxifloxacin, agreement was 83% to 85%; incorporating existing DNA sequencing information for discrepant analysis raised agreement to 91% to 96%. For MYCOTB, the median time to plate interpretation was 10 days and interreader agreement was ≥95% for all drugs. MYCOTB provided reliable results for M. tuberculosis susceptibility testing of first- and second-line drugs except ethambutol, and results were available sooner than those determined by APM.},

  abstract   = {Background: Introduction of Xpert® MTB/RIF assay has revolutionalised the diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB) by simultaneously detecting the bacteria and resistance to rifampicin (rif), a surrogate marker for multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB) as well as one of the principal first-line anti-tuberculosis drugs. In general, rpoB mutations can be found in 96.1% of rif-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) strains worldwide and these mutations usually are located in a region at the 507-533rd amino acid residuals (81 bp) in the MTB rpoB gene, which is referred to as Rifampicin-resistance-determining region (RRDR). In this study, we determined the frequency of MDR-TB in Kampala using Xpert® MTB/RIF in comparison with the agar proportion method using Middlebrook 7H11and further determined the frequency of probes for different rpoB gene mutations using Xpert® MTB/RIF assay in the 81 bp RRDR. Methods: A total of 1501 specimens received at Mycobacteriology laboratory, Makerere University for Xpert testing between May 2011 and May 2014 were analysed by Xpert® MTB/RIF assay. Specimens that were positive for both MTB and rifampicin resistance were further subjected to a complete first line anti-mycobacterial drug susceptibility testing using Middlebrook 7H11 agar proportion method (APM). Results: Xpert® MTB/RIF assay detected 313 MTB positive specimens and out of which 12 specimens had both MTB and rifampicin- resistance conferred by four different rpoB gene mutations in the 81 bp-RRDR of MTB, further one (1/12), specimen was found to be rifampicin mono-resistant on APM while the 11 were found to be MDR-TB. Probes associated with the observed rif- resistance were as follows: E (7/12), B (3/12), A (1/12), D (1/12) and no rif-resistance was associated with probe C. No specimen yielded rif-resistance associated with more than one probe failure (mutation combinations). Probe D was associated with rifampicin mono-resistant. Conclusions: MDR-TB was at 3.5% in the studied population. Mutations associated with Probe E (58%) also known as codons 531and 533 are the commonest rpoB gene mutation identified by Xpert® MTB/RIF assay in this setting and mutations identified by probe E of the assay, turned out to be MDR-TB strains by agar proportion method antimicrobial susceptibility testing. No mutation was detected in the codon 522.},

  abstract   = {Background: The two recent simultaneous developments of high-throughput sequencing and increased computational power have brought bioinformatics to the forefront as an important tool for effective and efficient biomedical research. Consequently, there have been multiple approaches to developing bioinformatics skills. In resource rich environments, it has been possible to develop and implement formal fully accredited graduate degree training programs in bioinformatics. In resource limited settings with a paucity of expert bioinformaticians, infrastructure and financial resources, the task has been approached by delivering short courses on bioinformatics—lasting only a few days to a couple of weeks. Alternatively, courses are offered online, usually over a period of a few months. These approaches are limited by both the lack of sustained in-person trainer–trainee interactions, which is a key part of quality mentorships and short durations which constrain the amount of learning that can be achieved. Methods: Here, we pioneered and tested a bioinformatics training/mentorship model that effectively uses the available expertise and computational infrastructure to deliver an in-person hands-on skills training experience. This is done through a few physical lecture hours each week, guided personal coursework over the rest of the week, group discussions and continuous close mentorship and assessment of trainees over a period of 1 year. Results: This model has now completed its third iteration at Makerere University and has successfully mentored trainees, who have progressed to a variety of viable career paths. Conclusions: One-year (intermediate) skills based in-person bioinformatics training and mentorships are viable, effective and particularly appropriate for resource limited settings.},

During the largest Chikungunya fever (CF) outbreak in Senegal in late 2023, with 210 confirmed cases in Kédougou and Tambacounda, the IPD evaluated the CDC Trioplex RT-qPCR assay, which detects Zika, Dengue, and Chikungunya viruses. Testing revealed a significant performance delay—an average 7 Ct value—compared to IPD’s in-house assay for 15 CHIKV RNA-positive samples. Whole genome sequencing and in silico analyses identified seven mismatches in the CDC Trioplex assay’s primer and probe binding sites for the CHIKV West Africa (WA) genotype, notably a critical mismatch at the 3’ end of the forward primer. This mismatch reduced elongation efficiency and caused a detection shift of approximately two logs, raising the risk of false negatives, especially for samples with low viral loads (Ct > 28). Conversely, the IPD in-house assay remained effective, with no mismatches detected against CHIKV WA genotype sequences. The findings highlight the need for continuous genomic surveillance and assay validation using region-specific viral strains to ensure diagnostic accuracy during outbreaks.},

  abstract   = {Brucellosis is a notifiable zoonotic disease affecting livestock, humans, and wildlife in Uganda. Pigs can be infected with human pathogenic Brucella suis biovars 1 and 3 and can be a significant source of brucellosis for humans. Uganda has a rapidly growing pig population, and the pork consumption per capita is the highest in East Africa. The objective of this work was to determine the seroprevalence of brucellosis in Ugandan pigs. A cross-sectional serosurvey of pigs was conducted in three of the major pig-keeping districts in Uganda (Masaka (n = 381 samples), Mukono (n = 398), and Kamuli (n = 414)). In addition, pigs originating from these districts were sampled in the major pig abattoir in Kampala (n = 472). In total, 1665 serum samples were investigated by serological and molecular tests. Only three putative brucellosis-positive samples were detected serologically using indirect ELISA. These sera were found negative for Brucella antibodies by CFT; however, two had antibodies against Yersinia enterocolitica as determined by SAT. Presence of antibodies against Yersiniae was confirmed by Y. enterocolitica antibody-specific ELISA. The two Yersiniae ELISA-positive samples were brucellosis negative using real-time PCR. We tested additional 142 sera from the 1665 samples with real-time PCR. All tested negative. Under this type of production system, we expect a maximum B. suis prevalence of less than 1 % at 95 % confidence level, and therefore, the risk of acquiring brucellosis from the pigs or their products is negligible. However, pigs may harbor the zoonotic Y. enterocolitica. This is the first study to investigate the occurrence of brucellosis in pigs in Uganda and the first study to report Y. enterocolitica antibodies in swine in Uganda.},

Discordance between tuberculin skin tests (TST) and interferon gamma release assays (IGRA) occurs in 10–20% of individuals, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Methods: We analyzed data from a prospective household contact study that included cough aerosol culture results from index cases, environmental and contact factors. We assessed contacts for LTBI using TST and IGRA at baseline and six weeks. We examined TST/IGRA discordance in qualitative and quantitative analyses, and used multivariable logistic regression analysis with generalized estimating equations to analyze predictors of discordance. Measurements and Results: We included 96 TB patients and 384 contacts. Discordance decreased from 15% at baseline to 8% by six weeks. In adjusted analyses, discordance was related to less crowding (p = 0.004), non-cavitary disease (OR 1.41, 95% CI: 1.02–1.96; p = 0.03), and marginally with BCG vaccination in contacts (OR 1.40, 95% CI: 0.99–1.98, p = 0.06). Conclusions: We observed significant individual variability and temporal dynamism in TST and IGRA results in household contacts of pulmonary TB cases. Discordance was associated with a less intense infectious exposure, and marginally associated with a BCG-mediated delay in IGRA conversion. Cough aerosols provide an additional dimension to the assessment of infectiousness and risk of infection in contacts.},

  abstract   = {Methods: This study assessed the acceptability and effectiveness of face masking as a protective measure against COVID-19 among high-risk groups in Uganda. A mixed-methods approach was used, combining surveys and focus group discussions to evaluate knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding face masking. Participants included healthcare workers, market vendors, public transport operators, and individuals with pre-existing health conditions. The study also analyzed mask-wearing compliance in public spaces and evaluated the effectiveness of masks through laboratory testing of filtration efficiency and wearability. Results: The study found high awareness (90%) of face masking as a protective measure, with 75% of participants regularly using masks in public. Market vendors and healthcare workers had the highest compliance rates, while public transport operators showed lower adherence. Laboratory analysis revealed that cloth masks commonly used in Uganda provided moderate protection, with a filtration efficiency of 50-70%. Participants cited affordability, discomfort, and limited access to quality masks as barriers to consistent use. Conclusion: Face masking is an acceptable and moderately effective COVID-19 protective measure among Ugandan high-risk groups. Increasing public access to affordable, high-quality masks and addressing barriers such as discomfort can improve compliance. Enhanced public health messaging tailored to specific groups is recommended to sustain mask-wearing practices.},

  abstract   = {Bacterial infections involving antibiotic-resistant gram-negative bacteria continue to increase and represent a major global public health concern. Resistance to antibiotics in these bacteria is mediated by chromosomal and/or acquired resistance mechanisms, these give rise to multi-drug resistant (MDR), extensive-drug resistant (XDR) or pan-drug resistant (PDR) bacterial strains. Most recently, plasmid-mediated resistance to colistin, an antibiotic that had been set apart as the last resort antibiotic in the treatment of infections involving MDR, XDR and PDR gram-negative bacteria has been reported. Plasmid-mediated colistin resistant gram-negative bacteria have been described to be PDR, implying a state devoid of alternative antibiotic therapeutic options. This review concisely describes the evolution of antibiotic resistance to plasmid-mediated colistin resistance and discusses the potential role of high-throughput sequencing technologies, genomics, and bioinformatics towards improving antibiotic resistance surveillance, the search for novel drug targets and precision antibiotic therapy focused at combating colistin resistance, and antibiotic resistance as a whole.},

The H3Africa was conceived to facilitate the application of genomics technologies to improve health across Africa.. Methods: CAfGEN is an H3Africa collaborative centre comprising expertise from the University of Botswana; Makerere University; Baylor College of Medicine Children's Clinical Centers of Excellence (COEs) in Botswana, Uganda, and Swaziland; as well as Baylor College of Medicine, Texas. The COEs provide clinical expertise for community engagement, participant recruitment and sample collection while the three University settings facilitate processing and management of genomic samples and provide infrastructure and training opportunities to sustain genomics research. Results: The project has focused on utilizing whole-exome sequencing to identify genetic variants contributing to extreme HIV disease progression phenotypes in children, as well as RNA sequencing and integrated genomics to identify host genetic factors associated with TB disease progression among HIV-positive children. These cohorts, developed using the COEs' electronic medical records, are exceptionally well-phenotyped and present an unprecedented opportunity to assess genetic factors in individuals whose HIV was acquired by a different route than their adult counterparts in the context of a unique clinical course and disease pathophysiology. Conclusions: Our approach offers the prospect of developing a critical mass of well-trained, highly-skilled, continent-based African genomic scientists. To ensure long term genomics research sustainability in Africa, CAfGEN contributes to a wide range of genomics capacity and infrastructure development on the continent, has laid a foundation for genomics graduate programs at its institutions, and continues to actively promote genomics research through innovative forms of community engagement brokered by partnerships with governments and academia to support genomics policy formulation.},

  abstract   = {Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection remains a significant public health burden globally. The role of viral co-infection in the rate of progression of HIV infection has been suggested but not empirically tested, particularly among children. We extracted and classified 42 viral species from whole-exome sequencing (WES) data of 813 HIV-infected children in Botswana and Uganda categorised as either long-term non-progressors (LTNPs) or rapid progressors (RPs). The Ugandan participants had a higher viral community diversity index compared to Batswana (p = 4.6 × 10−13), and viral sequences were more frequently detected among LTNPs than RPs (24% vs 16%; p = 0.008; OR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.6–2.3), with Anelloviridae showing strong association with LTNP status (p = 3 × 10−4; q = 0.004, OR, 3.99; 95% CI, 1.74–10.25). This trend was still evident when stratified by country, sex, and sequencing platform, and after a logistic regression analysis adjusting for age, sex, country, and the sequencing platform (p = 0.02; q = 0.03; OR, 7.3; 95% CI, 1.6–40.5). Torque teno virus (TTV), which made up 95% of the Anelloviridae reads, has been associated with reduced immune activation. We identify an association between viral co-infection and prolonged AIDs-free survival status that may have utility as a biomarker of LTNP and could provide mechanistic insights to HIV progression in children, demonstrating the added value of interrogating off-target WES reads in cohort studies.},

Traditional polygenic risk scores (PRS), which assess genetic predisposition based on genome-wide association studies, have shown promise in disease prediction but face limitations, especially in diverse populations. The authors advocate for the development of multi-omics risk scores (MoRS) that combine data from multiple omics layers to provide a more comprehensive assessment of disease risk. By integrating information from various biological processes, MoRS can capture the complex interactions between genetics, epigenetics, and environmental factors that contribute to disease development. The article emphasizes the importance of including diverse populations in genomic research to ensure the applicability of MoRS across different genetic backgrounds. Initiatives like the All of Us Research Program and Human Heredity and Health Africa (H3Africa) aim to address this disparity by increasing representation in global genome databases. The authors conclude that the integration of multi-omics data holds significant promise for advancing personalized medicine and improving the prediction and prevention of complex human diseases.},

Objective: We evaluated phospholipase, proteinase, hemolysin, esterase, and coagulase enzymatic activities and biofilm formation in Candida species isolated from people living with human immunodeficiency virus (PLHIV) with OPC. Methods: Thirty-five Candida isolates from PLHIV with OPC were retrieved from a sample repository and evaluated for phospholipase activity using the egg yolk agar method, proteinase activity using the bovine serum albumin agar method, hemolysin activity using the blood agar plate method, esterase activity using the Tween 80 opacity test medium method, coagulase activity using the classical tube method, and biofilm formation using the microtiter plate assay method in vitro. Results: A total of 35 Candida isolates obtained from PLHIV with OPC were included in this study, and phospholipase and proteinase activities were detected in 33/35 (94.3 %) and 31/35 (88.6 %) Candida isolates, respectively. Up to 25/35 (71.4 %) of the Candida isolates exhibited biofilm formation, whereas esterase activity was demonstrated in 23/35 (65.7 %) of the Candida isolates. Fewer isolates (21/35, 60 %) produced hemolysin, and coagulase production was the least common virulence activity detected in 18/35 (51.4 %) of the Candida isolates.

Methods: We screened ESBL-Ec at Bugando Medical Center (BMC) in Mwanza, Tanzania. Rectal swabs from orthopedic patients on admission and swabs from the neighboring inanimate environment were collected. Following microbial culture, DNA was extracted from pure ESBL-Ec, and whole-genome sequencing was done. Sequence typing (ST), plasmid replicons, drug resistance, and virulence genes were deciphered using the Rapid Microbial Analysis Pipeline (rMAP). Results: We obtained 209 ESBL isolates, of which 15 (7.2 %) were ESBL-Ec [8 (53.3 %) from patients and 7 (46.7 %) from the environment]. Seven isolates were novel and eight were diverse, each with a unique ST. All isolates harbored two to five β-lactamase genes, with the predominance of bla CTX-M-15 (15/15), bla OXA-1 (14/15), bla TEM (14/15) and bla ACT (12/15). The most common non β-lactam drug resistance genes were aac(3)-IIa (14/15), aac(6')-Ib-cr (14/15), fosA (14/15), and qnrB1 (12/15), aph(3″)-Ib (10/15) and aph(6)-Id (10/15). Eleven different types of plasmid replicons were identified in 14/15 of the isolates, harboring one to five plasmids, with the most common plasmids being IncFII (11/15) and IncFIB (10/15). All isolates harbored the outer membrane protein (ompA), and curli protein (csg) was in 14/15 isolates. Conclusion: Admitted orthopedic patients and the hospital environment act as a reservoir of ESBL-Ec with diverse STs and endowed with drug resistance and arsenals of virulence genes, calling for their routine screening on admission for mitigation of potential subsequent infections.},

We generated genomic data from 728 Vibrio cholerae O1 isolates predominantly collected between 2019-2024 to create the largest dataset of V. cholerae genomes sequenced locally in Africa. This dataset enabled us to interrogate recent patterns of spread, including the rapid circulation of the AFR15 lineage associated with unusually large outbreaks in Southern Africa. We provide evidence for the movement of the AFR15 lineage into new African Member States and confirm previously observed differences in V. cholerae transmission dynamics in West versus East Africa, though cross-border transmission is prevalent on both sides of the continent. Despite observed differences, evolutionary processes are similar across lineages and we find no evidence for significant changes in antimicrobial resistance genotypes. Overall, our findings emphasize the importance of regionally coordinated cross-border surveillance and interventions, while also demonstrating the critical role of locally generated genomic data in understanding the spread of cholera in Africa.},

  abstract   = {Background: Pediatric hepatitis B virus (HBV) serostatus remains variably characterized, hardly determined at times, or documented as part of national monitoring of the Extended Programs for Immunization (EPI). Methods: We cross-sectionally characterized the seroprevalence of HBV vaccine and/or infection status among 501 and 288 children <5 and 15–17 years old, respectively, in Kawempe Division, Kampala, Uganda, between May and August 2023. These children received HBV vaccination under the Uganda National Extended Program on Immunizations (UNEPI). Samples were qualitatively screened for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B surface antibody (HBsAb or anti-HBs), hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg), hepatitis B e antibody (HBeAb or anti-HBe), and for hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb or anti-HBc) using three different HBV Combo test rapid immunochromatographic diagnostic tests: Nova, Fastep, and Beright. Results: The seroprevalence of HBsAg, anti-HBs, HBeAg, anti-HBe, and anti-HBc was 1.52%, 27.75%, 0.88%, 0.63%, and 0.76%, respectively, for the combined study age groups. The HBsAg seroprevalence of 2.78% was almost 3.5-fold higher among adolescents when compared to the 0.8% observed in the under-5-year-olds. The qualitative seroprevalence of anti-HBs was 33.1% and 18.4% in the under-5 and among the 15–17-year-old study groups, respectively. Conclusions: The proportion of qualitatively detectable anti-HBs in both groups of vaccinated children is low and probably indicates reduced seroprotection. Consequently, a large proportion of children who received the hepatitis B vaccine under UNEPI may be at risk of HBV infection, especially adolescents. A booster dose of the Hepatitis B Vaccine may be required for adolescents.},

  abstract   = {Large-scale, population-based genomic studies have provided a context for modern medical genetics. Among such studies, however, African populations have remained relatively underrepresented. The breadth of genetic diversity across the African continent argues for an exploration of local genomic context to facilitate burgeoning disease mapping studies in Africa. We sought to characterize genetic variation and to assess population substructure within a cohort of HIV-positive children from Botswana-a Southern African country that is regionally underrepresented in genomic databases. Using whole-exome sequencing data from 164 Batswana and comparisons with 150 similarly sequenced HIV-positive Ugandan children, we found that 13%-25% of variation observed among Batswana was not captured by public databases. Uncaptured variants were significantly enriched (p = 2.2 × 10-16) for coding variants with minor allele frequencies between 1% and 5% and included predicted-damaging non-synonymous variants. Among variants found in public databases, corresponding allele frequencies varied widely, with Botswana having significantly higher allele frequencies among rare (<1%) pathogenic and damaging variants. Batswana clustered with other Southern African populations, but distinctly from 1000 Genomes African populations, and had limited evidence for admixture with extra-continental ancestries. We also observed a surprising lack of genetic substructure in Botswana, despite multiple tribal ethnicities and language groups, alongside a higher degree of relatedness than purported founder populations from the 1000 Genomes project. Our observations reveal a complex, but distinct, ancestral history and genomic architecture among Batswana and suggest that disease mapping within similar Southern African populations will require a deeper repository of genetic variation and allelic dependencies than presently exists.},

  abstract   = {Background: Mycobacterium tuberculosis presents several lineages each with distinct characteristics of evolutionary status, transmissibility, drug resistance, host interaction, latency, and vaccine efficacy. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) has emerged as a new diagnostic tool to reliably inform the occurrence of phylogenetic lineages of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and examine their relationship with patient demographic characteristics and multidrug-resistance development. Methods: 191 Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates obtained from a 2017/2018 Tanzanian drug resistance survey were sequenced on the Illumina Miseq platform at Supranational Tuberculosis Reference Laboratory in Uganda. Obtained fast-q files were imported into tools for resistance profiling and lineage inference (Kvarq v0.12.2, Mykrobe v0.8.1 and TBprofiler v3.0.5). Additionally for phylogenetic tree construction, RaxML-NG v1.0.3(25) was used to generate a maximum likelihood phylogeny with 800 bootstrap replicates. The resulting trees were plotted, annotated and visualized using ggtree v2.0.4. Results: Most [172(90.0%)] of the isolates were from newly treated Pulmonary TB patients. Coinfection with HIV was observed in 33(17.3%) TB patients. Of the 191 isolates, 22(11.5%) were resistant to one or more commonly used first line anti-TB drugs (FLD), 9(4.7%) isolates were MDR-TB while 3(1.6%) were resistant to all the drugs. Of the 24 isolates with any resistance conferring mutations, 13(54.2%) and 10(41.6%) had mutations in genes associated with resistance to INH and RIF respectively. The findings also show four major lineages i.e. Lineage 3[81 (42.4%)], followed by Lineage 4 [74 (38.7%)], the Lineage 1 [23 (12.0%)] and Lineages 2 [13 (6.8%)] circulaing in Tanzania. Conclusion: The findings in this study show that Lineage 3 is the most prevalent lineage in Tanzania whereas drug resistant mutations were more frequent among isolates that belonged to Lineage 4.},

  abstract   = {Background: Uganda remains one of the countries with the highest burden of TB/HIV. Drug-resistant TB remains a substantial challenge to TB control globally and requires new strategic effective control approaches. Drug resistance usually develops due to inadequate management of TB patients including improper treatment regimens and failure to complete the treatment course which may be due to an unstable supply or a lack of access to treatment, as well as patient noncompliance. Methods: Two sputa samples were collected from Xpert MTB/RIF® assay-diagnosed multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) patient at Lira regional referral hospital in northern Uganda between 2020 and 2021 for comprehensive routine mycobacterial species identification and drug susceptibility testing using culture-based methods. Detection of drug resistance-conferring genes was subsequently performed using whole-genome sequencing with Illumina MiSeq platform at the TB Supranational Reference Laboratory in Uganda. Results: In both isolates, extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) was identified including resistance to Isoniazid (katG p.Ser315Thr), Rifampicin (rpoB p.Ser450Leu), Moxifloxacin (gyrA p.Asp94Gly), Bedaquiline (Rv0678 Glu49fs), Clofazimine (Rv0678 Glu49fs), Linezolid (rplC Cys154Arg), and Ethionamide (ethA c.477del). Further analysis of these two high quality genomes revealed that this 32 years-old patient was infected with the Latin American Mediterranean TB strain (LAM). Conclusions: This is the first identification of extensively drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis clinical isolates with bedaquiline, linezolid and clofazimine resistance from Uganda. These acquired resistances were because of non-adherence as seen in the patient's clinical history. Our study also strongly highlights the importance of combating DR-TB in Africa through implementing next generation sequencing that can test resistance to all drugs while providing a faster turnaround time. This can facilitate timely clinical decisions in managing MDR-TB patients with non-adherence or lost to follow-up.},

Brucella abortus without a biovar designation was isolated from eleven out of 207 milk samples from cattle in Uganda. These isolates had a genomic monomorphism at 16 variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) loci and showed in turn high levels of genetic variation when compared with other African strains or other B. abortus biovars from other parts of the world.

Xpert testing includes dilution with sample reagent, and when processed sputum pellets are tested, the recommended sample reagent/pellet ratio is 3:1. We evaluated whether a decreased sample reagent/pellet ratio of 2:1 increased Xpert sensitivity compared to the recommended 3:1. The limit of detection was determined by inoculating serial dilutions of M. tuberculosis into sputum samples, preparing sputum pellets, and testing each pellet by Xpert at both sample reagent ratios. Processed sputum pellets obtained from M. tuberculosis culture-positive clinical specimens were also tested by Xpert at both ratios. Among spiked sputum pellets, the limit of detection was 1,478 CFU/ml (95% confidence interval [CI], 1,211 to 1,943) at a 3:1 ratio and decreased to 832 CFU/ml (95% CI, 671 to 1,134) at 2:1. The proportion of specimens in which M. tuberculosis was detected was greater at 2:1 than at 3:1 for almost all numbers of CFU/ml; this difference was most prominent at lower numbers of CFU/ml. Among 134 concentrated sputum pellets from the clinical study, the sensitivity of Xpert at 2:1 was greater than at 3:1 overall (80% versus 72%; P=0.03) and for smear-negative specimens (67% versus 58%; P=0.12). For Xpert testing of sputum pellets, using a lower sample reagent/pellet ratio increased M. tuberculosis detection, especially for paucibacillary specimens. Our study supports use of a 2:1 sample reagent/pellet dilution for Xpert testing of sputum pellets.},

  abstract   = {Background: Nosocomial infections are a major setback in the healthcare delivery system especially in developing countries due to the limited resources. The roles played by medical care equipment and work surfaces in the transmission of such organisms have inevitably contributed to the elevated mortality, morbidity and antibiotic resistances. Methods: A total 138 samples were collected during the study from Kawolo general hospital. Swab samples were collected from various work surfaces and fomites which consisted of; beds, sink taps, infusion stands, switches, work tables and scissors. Cultures were done and the susceptibility patterns of the isolates were determined using Kirby Bauer disc diffusion method. Data was analyzed using Stata 13 and Microsoft Excel 2013 packages. Results: A total of 44.2% (61/138) of the collected swab specimens represented the overall bacterial contamination of the sampled articles. Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae accounted for the highest bacterial contaminants constituting of 75.4% (46/61) and 11.5% (7/61) respectively. Infusion stands and patient beds were found to have the highest bacterial contamination levels both constituting 19.67% (12/61). The highest degree of transmission of organisms to patients was found to be statistically significant for patient beds with OR: 20.1 and P-value 8X10− 4. Vancomycin, ceftriaxone and ciprofloxacin were the most effective antibiotics with 100%, 80% and 80% sensitivity patterns among the isolates respectively. Multi-drug resistant (MDR) Staphylococcus aureus accounted for 52% (24/46) with 4% (1/24) classified as a possible extensively drug resistant (XDR) whereas Gram negative isolates had 27% (4/15) MDR strains out of which 50%(2/4) were classified as possible pan-drug resistant (PDR). Conclusion: The high prevalence of bacterial contaminants in the hospital work environment is an indicator of poor or ineffective decontamination. The study findings reiterate the necessity to formulate drug usage policies and reexamine effectiveness of decontamination and sterilization practices within Kawolo general hospital. We also recommend installation of a sound Microbiology unit at the hospital to take on susceptibility testing to check on the empirical use of antibiotics as a way of reducing the rampant elevations in drug resistances.},

  abstract   = {Background: Between January 2015 and July 2017, we investigated the frequency of carbapenem resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB) and carbapenem resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (CRPA) at the Mulago Hospital intensive care unit (ICU) in Kampala, Uganda. Carbapenemase production and carbapenemase gene carriage among CRAB and CRPA were determined; mobility potential of carbapenemase genes via horizontal gene transfer processes was also studied. Methods: Clinical specimens from 9269 patients were processed for isolation of CRAB and CRPA. Drug susceptibility testing was performed with the disk diffusion method. Carriage of carbapenemase genes and class 1 integrons was determined by PCR. Conjugation experiments that involved blaVIM positive CRAB/CRPA (donors) and sodium azide resistant Escherichia coli J53 (recipient) were performed. Results: The 9269 specimens processed yielded 1077 and 488 isolates of Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, respectively. Of these, 2.7% (29/1077) and 7.4% (36/488) were confirmed to be CRAB and CRPA respectively, but 46 were available for analysis (21 CRAB and 25 CRPA). Majority of specimens yielding CRAB and CRPA were from the ICU (78%) while 20 and 2% were from the ENT (Ear Nose & Throat) Department and the Burns Unit, respectively. Carbapenemase assays performed with the MHT assay showed that 40 and 33% of CRPA and CRAB isolates respectively, were carbapenemase producers. Also, 72 and 48% of CRPA and CRAB isolates respectively, were metallo-beta-lactamase producers. All the carbapenemase producing isolates were multidrug resistant but susceptible to colistin. blaVIM was the most prevalent carbapenemase gene, and it was detected in all CRAB and CRPA isolates while blaOXA-23 and blaOXA-24 were detected in 29 and 24% of CRAB isolates, respectively. Co-carriage of blaOXA-23 and blaOXA-24 occurred in 14% of CRAB isolates. Moreover, 63% of the study isolates carried class 1 integrons; of these 31% successfully transferred blaVIM to E. coli J53. Conclusions: CRAB and CRPA prevalence at the Mulago Hospital ICU is relatively low but carbapenemase genes especially blaVIM and blaOXA-23 are prevalent among them. This requires strengthening of infection control practices to curb selection and transmission of these strains in the hospital.},

  abstract   = {Ethiopia is the second most populous country in Africa and the sixth most affected by COVID-19 on the continent. Despite having experienced five infection waves, >499,000 cases, and ~7500 COVID-19-related deaths as of January 2023, there is still no detailed genomic epidemiological report on the introduction and spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Ethiopia. In this study, we reconstructed and elucidated the COVID-19 epidemic dynamics. Specifically, we investigated the introduction, local transmission, ongoing evolution, and spread of SARS-CoV-2 during the first four infection waves using 353 high-quality near-whole genomes sampled in Ethiopia. Our results show that whereas viral introductions seeded the first wave, subsequent waves were seeded by local transmission. The B.1.480 lineage emerged in the first wave and notably remained in circulation even after the emergence of the Alpha variant. The B.1.480 was outcompeted by the Delta variant. Notably, Ethiopia’s lack of local sequencing capacity was further limited by sporadic, uneven, and insufficient sampling that limited the incorporation of genomic epidemiology in the epidemic public health response in Ethiopia. These results highlight Ethiopia’s role in SARS-CoV-2 dissemination and the urgent need for balanced, near-real-time genomic sequencing.},

  abstract   = {Background: In January 2020, a previously unknown coronavirus strain was identified as the cause of a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2). The first viral whole-genome was sequenced using high-throughput sequencing from a sample collected in Wuhan, China. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) is imperative in investigating disease outbreak transmission dynamics and guiding decision-making in public health. Methods: We retrieved archived SARS-CoV-2 samples at the Integrated Biorepository of H3Africa Uganda, Makerere University (IBRH3AU). These samples were collected previously from individuals diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) using real-time reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). 30 samples with cycle thresholds (Cts) values <25 were selected for WGS using SARS-CoV-2 ARTIC protocol at Makerere University Molecular Diagnostics Laboratory. Results: 28 out of 30 (93.3%) samples generated analyzable genomic sequence reads. We detected SARS-CoV-2 and lineages A (22/28) and B (6/28) from the samples. We further show phylogenetic relatedness of these isolates alongside other 328 Uganda (lineage A = 222, lineage B = 106) SARS-CoV-2 genomes available in GISAID by April 22, 2021 and submitted by the Uganda Virus Research Institute. Conclusions: Our study demonstrated adoption and optimization of the low-cost ARTIC SARS-CoV-2 WGS protocol in a resource limited laboratory setting. This work has set a foundation to enable rapid expansion of SARS-CoV-2 WGS in Uganda as part of the Presidential Scientific Initiative on Epidemics (PRESIDE) CoV-bank project and IBRH3AU.},
