  abstract   = {The past 2 years, during which waves of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants swept the globe, have starkly highlighted health disparities across nations. Tegally et al. show how the coordinated efforts of talented African scientists have in a short time made great contributions to pandemic surveillance and data gathering. Their efforts and initiatives have provided early warning that has likely benefited wealthier countries more than their own. Genomic surveillance identified the emergence of the highly transmissible Beta and Omicron variants and now the appearance of Omicron sublineages in Africa. However, it is imperative that technology transfer for diagnostics and vaccines, as well the logistic wherewithal to produce and deploy them, match the data-gathering effort.},

  title    = {A machine learning approach to predict {E}. coli antibacterial resistance using whole-genome sequencing data},
  url      = {http://makir.mak.ac.ug/handle/10570/13162},
  abstract = {Background: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a significant global health threat, particularly impacting low- and middle-income countries(LMICS) such as Uganda, where reliable and rapid methods for detecting AMR in E. coli and other pathogens are scarce. This lack can lead to inappropriate treatment and the spread of drug-resistant infections. This thesis undertakes a comprehensive study, where various machine learning models to predict AMR in E. coli for ciprofloxacin(CIP), ampicillin(AMP), and cefotaxime(CTX) were trained on whole genome sequencing (WGS) data from England where such data is more readily available. A separate Ugandan dataset was used for validation purposes, further demonstrating the generalizability and effectiveness of the models in LMICS.
              
              Methods: 1496 (CIP), 1428 (CTX), and 1396 (AMP) sequences from England were divided into training and testing. 42 from Uganda were used for validation. Eight different machine learning models were trained and tested: Logistic Regression(LR), Random Forest(RF), Gradient Boosting(GB), XGBoost(XGB), LightGBM(LGBM), CatBoost(CB), Feed-Forward Neural Network(FFNN), and Support Vector Machine(SVM). The models were evaluated based on precision, recall, and Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC). Upsampling techniques were implemented to address class imbalance in the data.
              
              Results: Model predictive performance varied significantly across different antibiotics, underlining the critical role of model selection and dataset characteristics. Notably, the FFNN model demonstrated superior performance during testing for CIP (accuracy 84\%; F1 0.55; AUC 91\%), LR for CTX (accuracy 91\%; F1 0.37; AUC 83\%) and GB for AMP (accuracy 57\%; F1 0.62, AUC 53\%), while the LGBM and RF models outperformed others in same scenarios (p {\textless} 0.001). Upsampling did not significantly improve the models' performance, underscoring the complexity and high-dimensionality of SNP data. Despite high accuracy scores with the Ugandan validation dataset(FFNN with CIP accuracy 95\%, LR with AMP accuracy 98\% and GB with CTX accuracy 65\%), the models struggled with the recall metric due to severe class imbalance. Key mutations associated with antimicrobial resistance were identified for these antibiotics.
              
              Conclusion: As the threat of AMR continues to rise, the successful application of these models - particularly on the Ugandan dataset, signals a promising avenue for improving AMR detection and treatment strategies in LMICS were genomic data is scarce. This work thus not only expands our current understanding of the genetic underpinnings of AMR but also provides a robust methodological framework that can guide future research and applications in the fight against antimicrobial resistance.},

  abstract   = {The routine genomic surveillance of pathogens in diverse geographical settings and equitable data sharing are critical to inform effective infection control and therapeutic development. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic highlighted the importance of routine genomic surveillance of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to detect emerging variants of concern. However, the majority of high-income countries sequenced their COVID-19 cases, unlike low- and middle-income countries. By the end of 2022, many countries around the world had managed to establish capacity for pathogen genomic surveillance. Notably, Beta and Omicron 2 of the 5 current SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern were first discovered in Africa through an aggressive sequencing campaign led by African scientists. To sustain such infrastructure and expertise beyond this pandemic, other endemic pathogens should leverage this investment. Therefore, countries are establishing multi-pathogen genomic surveillance strategies. Here we provide a catalog of the current landscape of sequenced and publicly shared pathogens in different countries in Africa. Drawing upon our collective knowledge and expertise, we review the ever-evolving challenges and propose innovative recommendations.},
