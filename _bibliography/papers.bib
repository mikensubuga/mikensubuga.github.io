Tegally et al. show how the coordinated efforts of talented African scientists have in a short time made great contributions to pandemic surveillance and data gathering. Their efforts and initiatives have provided early warning that has likely benefited wealthier countries more than their own. Genomic surveillance identified the emergence of the highly transmissible Beta and Omicron variants and now the appearance of Omicron sublineages in Africa. However, it is imperative that technology transfer for diagnostics and vaccines, as well the logistic wherewithal to produce and deploy them, match the data-gathering effort.},

These regions often grapple with limited healthcare resources and access to advanced diagnostic tools. Consequently, there is a pressing need for innovative approaches that can enhance AMR surveillance and management. Machine learning (ML) though underutilized in these settings, presents a promising avenue. This study leverages ML models trained on whole-genome sequencing data from England, where such data is more readily available, to predict AMR in E. coli, targeting key antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin, ampicillin, and cefotaxime. A crucial part of our work involved the validation of these models using an independent dataset from Africa, specifically from Uganda, Nigeria, and Tanzania, to ascertain their applicability and effectiveness in LMICs.},

 abstract = {The advent of metagenomics has dramatically expanded our understanding of microbial
communities, particularly through the study of wastewater, which serves as a rich source of
microbial data. In Africa, wastewater metagenomics presents unparalleled opportunities for
public health monitoring, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) tracking, and the discovery of new
microbial species and functions. Utilizing high-throughput sequencing (HTS) technologies,
this method allows for direct analysis of nucleic acids from wastewater samples, providing a
cost-effective and comprehensive approach for pathogen surveillance. The potential of
wastewater metagenomics in Africa is vast. It can revolutionize public health monitoring by
acting as an early warning system for infectious disease outbreaks, offering near real-time
data to shape effective responses. This is especially critical in densely populated urban
areas with poor sanitation, where the risk of disease spread is high. Moreover, this approach
enables the detection of emerging pathogens and insights into environmental health. However,
the implementation of wastewater metagenomics in Africa faces several challenges.
These include variability in wastewater composition due to differing local customs, limited
infrastructure for sequencing and data analysis, and a shortage of bioinformatics expertise.
Socio-political and ethical issues also complicate data sharing and the equitable distribution
of benefits. To overcome these challenges, there is a need to enhance capacity through collaborative training, 
infrastructural development, and international partnerships. Investing
and sustaining local genomics and bioinformatics infrastructure and expertise is crucial.
Moreover, establishing robust data governance frameworks and engaging communities are
essential for leveraging metagenomics to advance scientific knowledge and deliver tangible
health and economic benefits. With strategic planning and collaboration, Africa can harness
the transformative potential of wastewater metagenomics to improve disease surveillance,
combat AMR, and foster scientific innovation, contributing significantly to sustainable development
and improved quality of life.},

  abstract   = {Rationale: Airborne transmission of Mycobacterium tuberculosis results from incompletely characterized host, bacterial, and environmental factors. Sputum smear microscopy is associated with considerable variability in transmission.

Objectives: To evaluate the use of cough-generated aerosols of M. tuberculosis to predict recent transmission.

Methods: Patients with pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) underwent a standard evaluation and collection of cough aerosol cultures of M. tuberculosis. We assessed household contacts for new M. tuberculosis infection. We used multivariable logistic regression analysis with cluster adjustment to analyze predictors of new infection.

Measurements and main results: From May 2009 to January 2011, we enrolled 96 sputum culture-positive index TB cases and their 442 contacts. Only 43 (45%) patients with TB yielded M. tuberculosis in aerosols. Contacts of patients with TB who produced high aerosols (≥10 CFU) were more likely to have a new infection compared with contacts from low-aerosol (1-9 CFU) and aerosol-negative cases (69%, 25%, and 30%, respectively; P = 0.009). A high-aerosol patient with TB was the only predictor of new M. tuberculosis infection in unadjusted (odds ratio, 5.18; 95% confidence interval, 1.52-17.61) and adjusted analyses (odds ratio, 4.81; 95% confidence interval, 1.20-19.23). Contacts of patients with TB with no aerosols versus low and high aerosols had differential tuberculin skin test and interferon-γ release assay responses.

Conclusions: Cough aerosols of M. tuberculosis are produced by a minority of patients with TB but predict transmission better than sputum smear microscopy or culture. Cough aerosols may help identify the most infectious patients with TB and thus improve the cost-effectiveness of TB control programs..},
