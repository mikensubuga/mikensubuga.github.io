Tegally et al. show how the coordinated efforts of talented African scientists have in a short time made great contributions to pandemic surveillance and data gathering. Their efforts and initiatives have provided early warning that has likely benefited wealthier countries more than their own. Genomic surveillance identified the emergence of the highly transmissible Beta and Omicron variants and now the appearance of Omicron sublineages in Africa. However, it is imperative that technology transfer for diagnostics and vaccines, as well the logistic wherewithal to produce and deploy them, match the data-gathering effort.},

Machine learning (ML) though underutilized in these settings, presents a promising avenue. This study leverages ML models trained on whole-genome sequencing data from England, where such data is more readily available, to predict AMR in E. coli, targeting key antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin, ampicillin, and cefotaxime.

 abstract = {The advent of metagenomics has dramatically expanded our understanding of microbial communities, particularly through the study of wastewater, which serves as a rich source of microbial data. In Africa, wastewater metagenomics presents unparalleled opportunities for public health monitoring, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) tracking, and the discovery of new microbial species and functions. Utilizing high-throughput sequencing (HTS) technologies, this method allows for direct analysis of nucleic acids from wastewater samples, providing a cost-effective and comprehensive approach for pathogen surveillance. The potential of wastewater metagenomics in Africa is vast. It can revolutionize public health monitoring by acting as an early warning system for infectious disease outbreaks, offering near real-time data to shape effective responses. This is especially critical in densely populated urban areas with poor sanitation, where the risk of disease spread is high. Moreover, this approach enables the detection of emerging pathogens and insights into environmental health. However, the implementation of wastewater metagenomics in Africa faces several challenges. These include variability in wastewater composition due to differing local customs, limited infrastructure for sequencing and data analysis, and a shortage of bioinformatics expertise. Socio-political and ethical issues also complicate data sharing and the equitable distribution of benefits. To overcome these challenges, there is a need to enhance capacity through collaborative training, infrastructural development, and international partnerships. Investing and sustaining local genomics and bioinformatics infrastructure and expertise is crucial. Moreover, establishing robust data governance frameworks and engaging communities are essential for leveraging metagenomics to advance scientific knowledge and deliver tangible health and economic benefits. With strategic planning and collaboration, Africa can harness the transformative potential of wastewater metagenomics to improve disease surveillance, combat AMR, and foster scientific innovation, contributing significantly to sustainable development and improved quality of life.},

  abstract   = {Rationale: Airborne transmission of Mycobacterium tuberculosis results from incompletely characterized host, bacterial, and environmental factors. Sputum smear microscopy is associated with considerable variability in transmission. Objectives: To evaluate the use of cough-generated aerosols of M. tuberculosis to predict recent transmission. Methods: Patients with pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) underwent a standard evaluation and collection of cough aerosol cultures of M. tuberculosis. We assessed household contacts for new M. tuberculosis infection. We used multivariable logistic regression analysis with cluster adjustment to analyze predictors of new infection. Measurements and main results: From May 2009 to January 2011, we enrolled 96 sputum culture-positive index TB cases and their 442 contacts. Only 43 (45%) patients with TB yielded M. tuberculosis in aerosols. Contacts of patients with TB who produced high aerosols (≥10 CFU) were more likely to have a new infection compared with contacts from low-aerosol (1-9 CFU) and aerosol-negative cases (69%, 25%, and 30%, respectively; P = 0.009). A high-aerosol patient with TB was the only predictor of new M. tuberculosis infection in unadjusted (odds ratio, 5.18; 95% confidence interval, 1.52-17.61) and adjusted analyses (odds ratio, 4.81; 95% confidence interval, 1.20-19.23). Contacts of patients with TB with no aerosols versus low and high aerosols had differential tuberculin skin test and interferon-γ release assay responses. Conclusions: Cough aerosols of M. tuberculosis are produced by a minority of patients with TB but predict transmission better than sputum smear microscopy or culture. Cough aerosols may help identify the most infectious patients with TB and thus improve the cost-effectiveness of TB control programs..},

Once the analysis is finished, rMAP generates an interactive web-like html report. rMAP installation is very simple, it can be run using very simple commands. It represents a rapid and easy way to perform comprehensive bacterial WGS analysis using a personal laptop in low-income settings where high-performance computing infrastructure is limited.},

This study sought to verify extent of immune protection accorded by the HBV vaccine in African children of up to 17 years of age by pooling the prevalence of seroprotection reported by primary studies conducted in the Northern, Western, and Southern African regions. We included 19 eligible articles out of the 197 initially downloaded, published from 1999 to 2021 from African Journals Online (AJOL), EMBASE, Scopus, and PubMed. The study protocol was registered with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO), University of York Centre for Reviews and Dissemination, under the registration number CRD42022361277. Significantly higher (p < 0.0001) proportion of HBV vaccine seroprotection (69.07%) was found among children under 15 years of age than children 15–17 years (32.368%), 95% CI [34.2454–39.0847%]. Whereas successful integration of the HBV vaccine on the extended programs on immunizations (EPI) has been a major achievement in the reduction of HBV infection in Africa, markedly reduced HBV vaccine seroprotection is persistently demonstrated among adolescent children 15–17 years of age. Future studies are required to clarify the need for booster dose vaccination in most at risk populations and age groups.},

Fifty-six P. aeruginosa clinical isolates were obtained from six medical centers across five counties in Kenya between 2015 and 2020. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was performed to conduct genomic characterization, sequence typing, and phylogenetic analysis of the isolates. Results showed the presence of globally distributed high-risk clones (ST244 and ST357), local high-risk clones (ST2025, ST455, and ST233), and a novel multidrug-resistant (MDR) clone carrying virulence genes (ST3674). Furthermore, 31% of the study isolates were found to be MDR with phenotypic resistance to a variety of antibiotics, including piperacillin (79%), ticarcillin-clavulanic acid (57%), meropenem (34%), levofloxacin (70%), and cefepime (32%). Several resistance genes were identified, including carbapenemases VIM-6 (ST1203) and NDM-1 (ST357), fluoroquinolone genes, crpP, and qnrVCi, while 14 and 22 different chromosomal mutations were detected in the gyrA and parC genes, respectively. All isolates contained at least three virulence genes. Among the virulence genes identified, phzB1 was the most abundant (50/56, 89%). About 21% (12/56) of the isolates had the exoU+/exoS- genotype, while 73% (41/56) of the isolates had the exoS+/exoU- genotype. This study also discovered 12 novel lineages of P. aeruginosa, of which one (ST3674) demonstrated both extensive antimicrobial resistance and the highest number of virulence genes (236/242, 98%). Although most high-risk clones were detected in Nairobi County, high-risk and clones of interest were found throughout the country, indicating the local spread of global epidemic clones and the emergence of new strains. Thus, this study illustrates the urgent need for coordinated local, regional, and international antimicrobial resistance surveillance efforts.},

  abstract   = {For Mycobacterium tuberculosis, phenotypic methods for drug susceptibility testing of second-line drugs are poorly standardized and technically challenging. The Sensititre MYCOTB MIC plate (MYCOTB) is a microtiter plate containing lyophilized antibiotics and configured for determination of MICs to first- and second-line antituberculosis drugs. To evaluate the performance of MYCOTB for M. tuberculosis drug susceptibility testing using the Middlebrook 7H10 agar proportion method (APM) as the comparator, we conducted a two-site study using archived M. tuberculosis isolates from Uganda and the Republic of Korea. Thawed isolates were subcultured, and dilutions were inoculated into MYCOTB wells and onto 7H10 agar. MYCOTB results were read at days 7, 10, 14, and 21; APM results were read at 21 days. A total of 222 isolates provided results on both platforms. By APM, 106/222 (47.7%) of isolates were resistant to at least isoniazid and rifampin. Agreement between MYCOTB and APM with respect to susceptibility or resistance was ≥92% for 7 of 12 drugs when a strict definition was used and ≥96% for 10 of 12 drugs when agreement was defined by allowing a ± one-well range of dilutions around the APM critical concentration. For ethambutol, agreement was 80% to 81%. For moxifloxacin, agreement was 83% to 85%; incorporating existing DNA sequencing information for discrepant analysis raised agreement to 91% to 96%. For MYCOTB, the median time to plate interpretation was 10 days and interreader agreement was ≥95% for all drugs. MYCOTB provided reliable results for M. tuberculosis susceptibility testing of first- and second-line drugs except ethambutol, and results were available sooner than those determined by APM.},

  abstract   = {Background: Introduction of Xpert® MTB/RIF assay has revolutionalised the diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB) by simultaneously detecting the bacteria and resistance to rifampicin (rif), a surrogate marker for multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB) as well as one of the principal first-line anti-tuberculosis drugs. In general, rpoB mutations can be found in 96.1% of rif-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) strains worldwide and these mutations usually are located in a region at the 507-533rd amino acid residuals (81 bp) in the MTB rpoB gene, which is referred to as Rifampicin-resistance-determining region (RRDR). In this study, we determined the frequency of MDR-TB in Kampala using Xpert® MTB/RIF in comparison with the agar proportion method using Middlebrook 7H11and further determined the frequency of probes for different rpoB gene mutations using Xpert® MTB/RIF assay in the 81 bp RRDR. Methods: A total of 1501 specimens received at Mycobacteriology laboratory, Makerere University for Xpert testing between May 2011 and May 2014 were analysed by Xpert® MTB/RIF assay. Specimens that were positive for both MTB and rifampicin resistance were further subjected to a complete first line anti-mycobacterial drug susceptibility testing using Middlebrook 7H11 agar proportion method (APM). Results: Xpert® MTB/RIF assay detected 313 MTB positive specimens and out of which 12 specimens had both MTB and rifampicin- resistance conferred by four different rpoB gene mutations in the 81 bp-RRDR of MTB, further one (1/12), specimen was found to be rifampicin mono-resistant on APM while the 11 were found to be MDR-TB. Probes associated with the observed rif- resistance were as follows: E (7/12), B (3/12), A (1/12), D (1/12) and no rif-resistance was associated with probe C. No specimen yielded rif-resistance associated with more than one probe failure (mutation combinations). Probe D was associated with rifampicin mono-resistant. Conclusions: MDR-TB was at 3.5% in the studied population. Mutations associated with Probe E (58%) also known as codons 531and 533 are the commonest rpoB gene mutation identified by Xpert® MTB/RIF assay in this setting and mutations identified by probe E of the assay, turned out to be MDR-TB strains by agar proportion method antimicrobial susceptibility testing. No mutation was detected in the codon 522.},

  abstract   = {Background: The two recent simultaneous developments of high-throughput sequencing and increased computational power have brought bioinformatics to the forefront as an important tool for effective and efficient biomedical research. Consequently, there have been multiple approaches to developing bioinformatics skills. In resource rich environments, it has been possible to develop and implement formal fully accredited graduate degree training programs in bioinformatics. In resource limited settings with a paucity of expert bioinformaticians, infrastructure and financial resources, the task has been approached by delivering short courses on bioinformatics—lasting only a few days to a couple of weeks. Alternatively, courses are offered online, usually over a period of a few months. These approaches are limited by both the lack of sustained in-person trainer–trainee interactions, which is a key part of quality mentorships and short durations which constrain the amount of learning that can be achieved. Methods: Here, we pioneered and tested a bioinformatics training/mentorship model that effectively uses the available expertise and computational infrastructure to deliver an in-person hands-on skills training experience. This is done through a few physical lecture hours each week, guided personal coursework over the rest of the week, group discussions and continuous close mentorship and assessment of trainees over a period of 1 year. Results: This model has now completed its third iteration at Makerere University and has successfully mentored trainees, who have progressed to a variety of viable career paths. Conclusions: One-year (intermediate) skills based in-person bioinformatics training and mentorships are viable, effective and particularly appropriate for resource limited settings.},

  abstract   = {Since 2015, the virology laboratory at Institut Pasteur de Dakar (IPD) has conducted real-time molecular diagnostics for arboviruses as part of Senegal's syndromic sentinel surveillance network. During the largest Chikungunya fever (CF) outbreak in Senegal in late 2023, with 210 confirmed cases in Kédougou and Tambacounda, the IPD evaluated the CDC Trioplex RT-qPCR assay, which detects Zika, Dengue, and Chikungunya viruses. Testing revealed a significant performance delay—an average 7 Ct value—compared to IPD’s in-house assay for 15 CHIKV RNA-positive samples. Whole genome sequencing and in silico analyses identified seven mismatches in the CDC Trioplex assay’s primer and probe binding sites for the CHIKV West Africa (WA) genotype, notably a critical mismatch at the 3’ end of the forward primer. This mismatch reduced elongation efficiency and caused a detection shift of approximately two logs, raising the risk of false negatives, especially for samples with low viral loads (Ct > 28). Conversely, the IPD in-house assay remained effective, with no mismatches detected against CHIKV WA genotype sequences. The findings highlight the need for continuous genomic surveillance and assay validation using region-specific viral strains to ensure diagnostic accuracy during outbreaks.},

  abstract   = {Brucellosis is a notifiable zoonotic disease affecting livestock, humans, and wildlife in Uganda. Pigs can be infected with human pathogenic Brucella suis biovars 1 and 3 and can be a significant source of brucellosis for humans. Uganda has a rapidly growing pig population, and the pork consumption per capita is the highest in East Africa. The objective of this work was to determine the seroprevalence of brucellosis in Ugandan pigs. A cross-sectional serosurvey of pigs was conducted in three of the major pig-keeping districts in Uganda (Masaka (n = 381 samples), Mukono (n = 398), and Kamuli (n = 414)). In addition, pigs originating from these districts were sampled in the major pig abattoir in Kampala (n = 472). In total, 1665 serum samples were investigated by serological and molecular tests. Only three putative brucellosis-positive samples were detected serologically using indirect ELISA. These sera were found negative for Brucella antibodies by CFT; however, two had antibodies against Yersinia enterocolitica as determined by SAT. Presence of antibodies against Yersiniae was confirmed by Y. enterocolitica antibody-specific ELISA. The two Yersiniae ELISA-positive samples were brucellosis negative using real-time PCR. We tested additional 142 sera from the 1665 samples with real-time PCR. All tested negative. Under this type of production system, we expect a maximum B. suis prevalence of less than 1 % at 95 % confidence level, and therefore, the risk of acquiring brucellosis from the pigs or their products is negligible. However, pigs may harbor the zoonotic Y. enterocolitica. This is the first study to investigate the occurrence of brucellosis in pigs in Uganda and the first study to report Y. enterocolitica antibodies in swine in Uganda.},

Discordance between tuberculin skin tests (TST) and interferon gamma release assays (IGRA) occurs in 10–20% of individuals, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Methods: We analyzed data from a prospective household contact study that included cough aerosol culture results from index cases, environmental and contact factors. We assessed contacts for LTBI using TST and IGRA at baseline and six weeks. We examined TST/IGRA discordance in qualitative and quantitative analyses, and used multivariable logistic regression analysis with generalized estimating equations to analyze predictors of discordance. Measurements and Results: We included 96 TB patients and 384 contacts. Discordance decreased from 15% at baseline to 8% by six weeks. In adjusted analyses, discordance was related to less crowding (p = 0.004), non-cavitary disease (OR 1.41, 95% CI: 1.02–1.96; p = 0.03), and marginally with BCG vaccination in contacts (OR 1.40, 95% CI: 0.99–1.98, p = 0.06). Conclusions: We observed significant individual variability and temporal dynamism in TST and IGRA results in household contacts of pulmonary TB cases. Discordance was associated with a less intense infectious exposure, and marginally associated with a BCG-mediated delay in IGRA conversion. Cough aerosols provide an additional dimension to the assessment of infectiousness and risk of infection in contacts.},

A mixed-methods approach was used, combining surveys and focus group discussions to evaluate knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding face masking. Participants included healthcare workers, market vendors, public transport operators, and individuals with pre-existing health conditions. The study also analyzed mask-wearing compliance in public spaces and evaluated the effectiveness of masks through laboratory testing of filtration efficiency and wearability. Results: The study found high awareness (90%) of face masking as a protective measure, with 75% of participants regularly using masks in public. Market vendors and healthcare workers had the highest compliance rates, while public transport operators showed lower adherence. Laboratory analysis revealed that cloth masks commonly used in Uganda provided moderate protection, with a filtration efficiency of 50-70%. Participants cited affordability, discomfort, and limited access to quality masks as barriers to consistent use. Conclusion: Face masking is an acceptable and moderately effective COVID-19 protective measure among Ugandan high-risk groups. Increasing public access to affordable, high-quality masks and addressing barriers such as discomfort can improve compliance. Enhanced public health messaging tailored to specific groups is recommended to sustain mask-wearing practices.},

The H3Africa was conceived to facilitate the application of genomics technologies to improve health across Africa.. Methods: CAfGEN is an H3Africa collaborative centre comprising expertise from the University of Botswana; Makerere University; Baylor College of Medicine Children's Clinical Centers of Excellence (COEs) in Botswana, Uganda, and Swaziland; as well as Baylor College of Medicine, Texas. The COEs provide clinical expertise for community engagement, participant recruitment and sample collection while the three University settings facilitate processing and management of genomic samples and provide infrastructure and training opportunities to sustain genomics research. Results: The project has focused on utilizing whole-exome sequencing to identify genetic variants contributing to extreme HIV disease progression phenotypes in children, as well as RNA sequencing and integrated genomics to identify host genetic factors associated with TB disease progression among HIV-positive children. These cohorts, developed using the COEs' electronic medical records, are exceptionally well-phenotyped and present an unprecedented opportunity to assess genetic factors in individuals whose HIV was acquired by a different route than their adult counterparts in the context of a unique clinical course and disease pathophysiology. Conclusions: Our approach offers the prospect of developing a critical mass of well-trained, highly-skilled, continent-based African genomic scientists. To ensure long term genomics research sustainability in Africa, CAfGEN contributes to a wide range of genomics capacity and infrastructure development on the continent, has laid a foundation for genomics graduate programs at its institutions, and continues to actively promote genomics research through innovative forms of community engagement brokered by partnerships with governments and academia to support genomics policy formulation.},

  abstract   = {Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection remains a significant public health burden globally. The role of viral co-infection in the rate of progression of HIV infection has been suggested but not empirically tested, particularly among children. We extracted and classified 42 viral species from whole-exome sequencing (WES) data of 813 HIV-infected children in Botswana and Uganda categorised as either long-term non-progressors (LTNPs) or rapid progressors (RPs). The Ugandan participants had a higher viral community diversity index compared to Batswana (p = 4.6 × 10−13), and viral sequences were more frequently detected among LTNPs than RPs (24% vs 16%; p = 0.008; OR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.6–2.3), with Anelloviridae showing strong association with LTNP status (p = 3 × 10−4; q = 0.004, OR, 3.99; 95% CI, 1.74–10.25). This trend was still evident when stratified by country, sex, and sequencing platform, and after a logistic regression analysis adjusting for age, sex, country, and the sequencing platform (p = 0.02; q = 0.03; OR, 7.3; 95% CI, 1.6–40.5). Torque teno virus (TTV), which made up 95% of the Anelloviridae reads, has been associated with reduced immune activation. We identify an association between viral co-infection and prolonged AIDs-free survival status that may have utility as a biomarker of LTNP and could provide mechanistic insights to HIV progression in children, demonstrating the added value of interrogating off-target WES reads in cohort studies.},

  abstract   = {The article "Unlocking the Future of Complex Human Disease Prediction: Multi-Omics Risk Score Breakthrough" discusses the potential of integrating various high-throughput screening technologies—such as genomics, DNA methylomics, metagenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics—to enhance the prediction of complex human diseases. Traditional polygenic risk scores (PRS), which assess genetic predisposition based on genome-wide association studies, have shown promise in disease prediction but face limitations, especially in diverse populations. The authors advocate for the development of multi-omics risk scores (MoRS) that combine data from multiple omics layers to provide a more comprehensive assessment of disease risk. By integrating information from various biological processes, MoRS can capture the complex interactions between genetics, epigenetics, and environmental factors that contribute to disease development. The article emphasizes the importance of including diverse populations in genomic research to ensure the applicability of MoRS across different genetic backgrounds. Initiatives like the All of Us Research Program and Human Heredity and Health Africa (H3Africa) aim to address this disparity by increasing representation in global genome databases. The authors conclude that the integration of multi-omics data holds significant promise for advancing personalized medicine and improving the prediction and prevention of complex human diseases.},

  abstract   = {Background: Commensal oral Candida species can become opportunistic and transition to pathogenic causes of oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC) in individuals with impaired immunity through ecological cues and the expression of extracellular hydrolytic enzyme activities and biofilm formation. Objective: We evaluated phospholipase, proteinase, hemolysin, esterase, and coagulase enzymatic activities and biofilm formation in Candida species isolated from people living with human immunodeficiency virus (PLHIV) with OPC. Methods: Thirty-five Candida isolates from PLHIV with OPC were retrieved from a sample repository and evaluated for phospholipase activity using the egg yolk agar method, proteinase activity using the bovine serum albumin agar method, hemolysin activity using the blood agar plate method, esterase activity using the Tween 80 opacity test medium method, coagulase activity using the classical tube method, and biofilm formation using the microtiter plate assay method in vitro. Results: A total of 35 Candida isolates obtained from PLHIV with OPC were included in this study, and phospholipase and proteinase activities were detected in 33/35 (94.3 %) and 31/35 (88.6 %) Candida isolates, respectively. Up to 25/35 (71.4 %) of the Candida isolates exhibited biofilm formation, whereas esterase activity was demonstrated in 23/35 (65.7 %) of the Candida isolates. Fewer isolates (21/35, 60 %) produced hemolysin, and coagulase production was the least common virulence activity detected in 18/35 (51.4 %) of the Candida isolates. Conclusion: Phospholipase and proteinase activities were the strongest in oropharyngeal Candida species.},

  abstract   = {Objectives: We investigated the genomic epidemiology of extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacter cloacae (ESBL-Ec) isolates from patients and hospital environment to better understand their distribution to help devising effective strategies for infection prevention and control. Methods: We screened ESBL-Ec at Bugando Medical Center (BMC) in Mwanza, Tanzania. Rectal swabs from orthopedic patients on admission and swabs from the neighboring inanimate environment were collected. Following microbial culture, DNA was extracted from pure ESBL-Ec, and whole-genome sequencing was done. Sequence typing (ST), plasmid replicons, drug resistance, and virulence genes were deciphered using the Rapid Microbial Analysis Pipeline (rMAP). Results: We obtained 209 ESBL isolates, of which 15 (7.2 %) were ESBL-Ec [8 (53.3 %) from patients and 7 (46.7 %) from the environment]. Seven isolates were novel and eight were diverse, each with a unique ST. All isolates harbored two to five β-lactamase genes, with the predominance of bla CTX-M-15 (15/15), bla OXA-1 (14/15), bla TEM (14/15) and bla ACT (12/15). The most common non β-lactam drug resistance genes were aac(3)-IIa (14/15), aac(6')-Ib-cr (14/15), fosA (14/15), and qnrB1 (12/15), aph(3″)-Ib (10/15) and aph(6)-Id (10/15). Eleven different types of plasmid replicons were identified in 14/15 of the isolates, harboring one to five plasmids, with the most common plasmids being IncFII (11/15) and IncFIB (10/15). All isolates harbored the outer membrane protein (ompA), and curli protein (csg) was in 14/15 isolates. Conclusion: Admitted orthopedic patients and the hospital environment act as a reservoir of ESBL-Ec with diverse STs and endowed with drug resistance and arsenals of virulence genes, calling for their routine screening on admission for mitigation of potential subsequent infections.},

Rectal swabs were collected for screening β-lactamases-producing Acinetobacter baumannii among hospitalized orthopedic patients at a tertiary referral hospital in Tanzania. Swabs were also taken from patients' caretakers, healthcare workers, and the neighboring inanimate environment. A total of 26 confirmed β-lactamases producing Acinetobacter baumannii were isolated, of which 4 representative isolates (two from patients and two from hospital environment) underwent whole-genome sequencing (WGS) to detect sequence types (ST), β-lactamases genes, plasmid replicon types, and virulence genes. All four isolates harbored multiple β-lactamases genes including blaADC-25(3), blaOXA(4), blaCTX-M-15(2) and blaNDM-1(2). Furthermore, isolates harbored virulence genes encoding outer membrane protein (ompA), curli protein (csg), siderophore biosynthesis systems (enterobactin [entABCDEFS, fepABCDG, fes]; yersiniabactin [ybtAEPQSTUX, irp1, irp2, fyuA] and aerobactin [iucABCD, iutA]), transport secretion system type II (T2SS) and type III (T3SS), E. coli common pilus (ecpRABCDE operon), type 1 fimbriae (fim), arylsulfatase (aslA) and adhesions (fedC).

  abstract   = {Cholera remains a significant public health burden in many countries in sub-Saharan Africa, though the exact mechanisms of bacterial emergence and spread remain largely undefined. We generated genomic data from 728 Vibrio cholerae O1 isolates predominantly collected between 2019-2024 to create the largest dataset of V. cholerae genomes sequenced locally in Africa. This dataset enabled us to interrogate recent patterns of spread, including the rapid circulation of the AFR15 lineage associated with unusually large outbreaks in Southern Africa. We provide evidence for the movement of the AFR15 lineage into new African Member States and confirm previously observed differences in V. cholerae transmission dynamics in West versus East Africa, though cross-border transmission is prevalent on both sides of the continent. Despite observed differences, evolutionary processes are similar across lineages and we find no evidence for significant changes in antimicrobial resistance genotypes. Overall, our findings emphasize the importance of regionally coordinated cross-border surveillance and interventions, while also demonstrating the critical role of locally generated genomic data in understanding the spread of cholera in Africa.},
