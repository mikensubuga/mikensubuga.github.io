<a href="https://www.gatesfoundation.org/about/committed-grants/2021/10/inv036379">This project bridges gaps in genomic surveillance by leveraging commercially available RT-qPCR assays as a rapid, cost-effective solution for SARS-CoV-2 VOC screening. It enhances Africa's ability to detect and respond to emerging variants, contributing to stronger public health systems and preparedness for future pandemics.
