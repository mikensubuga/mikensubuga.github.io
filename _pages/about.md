Hi, I’m Gerald Mboowa, a bioinformatics implementation expert dedicated to advancing global health through cutting-edge research and data-driven solutions, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).

I am currently contributing to impactful global health projects as part of my role at the <a href="https://www.broadinstitute.org/">Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard</a>, building on years of experience in implementing bioinformatics frameworks for infectious disease surveillance. My expertise focuses on the application of next-generation sequencing, machine learning, and genomic data analysis to solve critical public health challenges.

My work spans antimicrobial resistance, genomics, and infectious disease surveillance, with a particular focus on creating equitable solutions for LMICs. I have collaborated with global health organizations such as Africa CDC, where I participated in implementing genomic surveillance programs to strengthen disease detection and response capabilities across the continent.

I am deeply passionate about translating research into actionable public health outcomes and fostering innovations in education and health systems. My projects involve leveraging advanced bioinformatics tools to characterize pathogens, address drug resistance and improve public health. I am also supporting Genomics, Bioinformatics, and Data Science programs at the <a href="https://ace.ac.ug/">African Center of Excellence in Bioinformatics & Data-intensive Sciences(ACE) and <a href="https://chs.mak.ac.ug/team/gerald-mboowa" target="_blank">Makerere University</a>

Let’s connect to explore collaborative opportunities in advancing global health, genomics, and public health innovation!
