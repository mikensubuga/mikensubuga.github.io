Hi, I’m Gerald Mboowa, a bioinformatics implementation expert dedicated to advancing global health through innovative research and data-driven solutions, with a particular focus on low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).

Currently, I contribute to transformative global health initiatives at the <a href="https://www.broadinstitute.org/">Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard</a>, building on extensive experience in developing and implementing bioinformatics frameworks for infectious disease surveillance. My expertise lies at the intersection of next-generation sequencing (NGS), machine learning, and genomic data analysis, enabling solutions to critical public health challenges.

My work encompasses antimicrobial resistance (AMR), genomics, and infectious disease surveillance, with a strong emphasis on fostering equitable solutions for LMICs. Previously, I collaborated with global organizations such as Africa CDC to implement genomic surveillance programs, enhancing disease detection and response systems across Africa.

Driven by a passion for translating research into actionable public health outcomes, I focus on leveraging advanced bioinformatics tools to characterize pathogens, address drug resistance, and improve health systems. I also actively support Genomics, Bioinformatics, and Data Science programs at the <a href="https://ace.ac.ug/">African Center of Excellence in Bioinformatics & Data-intensive Sciences (ACE)</a> and <a href="https://chs.mak.ac.ug/team/gerald-mboowa" target="_blank">Makerere University</a>.

Let’s connect and collaborate to advance global health, genomics, and public health innovation!
