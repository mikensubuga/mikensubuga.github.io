Hi, I’m Gerald Mboowa, a bioinformatics implementation expert dedicated to advancing global health through cutting-edge research and data-driven solutions, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).

I am currently contributing to impactful global health projects as part of my role at the Broad Institute, building on years of experience in implementing bioinformatics frameworks for infectious disease surveillance. My expertise focuses on the application of next-generation sequencing, machine learning, and genomic data analysis to solve critical public health challenges.

Previously, I pursued an MSc in Bioinformatics at Makerere University, Uganda, supported by the Fogarty International Center (FIC) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) under the EANBIT project. My research emphasized developing and evaluating practical machine learning models for identifying antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in LMICs. These efforts have informed strategies for addressing AMR in resource-limited settings.

My work spans antimicrobial resistance, genomics, and infectious disease surveillance, with a particular focus on creating equitable solutions for LMICs. I have collaborated with global health organizations such as Africa CDC, where I implemented genomic surveillance systems to strengthen disease detection and response capabilities across the continent.

I am deeply passionate about translating research into actionable public health outcomes and fostering innovations in education and health systems. My current projects involve leveraging advanced bioinformatics tools to address HIV drug resistance and improve genomic medicine in Africa.

Let’s connect to explore collaborative opportunities in advancing global health, genomics, and public health innovation!
