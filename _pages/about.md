Hi, I’m Gerald Mboowa, a bioinformatics implementation expert committed to advancing global health through innovative research and data-driven solutions, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). My work integrates genome sequencing technologies and bioinformatics into public health strategies to address critical health challenges. As an implementation scientist, I have developed, alongside my team, two impactful bioinformatics pipelines: <a href="https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/mgen/10.1099/mgen.0.000583">rMAP (Rapid Microbial Analysis Pipeline)</a> and <a href="https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/acmi/10.1099/acmi.0.000815.v3">HIV-DRIVES (HIV Drug Resistance Identification, Variant Evaluation, and Surveillance Pipeline)</a>. These tools significantly enhance antimicrobial resistance (AMR) surveillance and pathogen characterization, supporting outbreak investigations and evidence-based public health decision-making.

The rMAP pipeline facilitates the rapid identification of genomic determinants of resistance and virulence, offering actionable insights to develop targeted interventions and inform AMR policies. Meanwhile, HIV-DRIVES focuses on identifying HIV drug resistance, evaluating variants, and enabling robust surveillance. Together, these pipelines empower health systems—especially in LMICs—with the capacity to utilize genomic data for real-time disease monitoring and response, transforming how public health challenges are addressed.

With expertise spanning next-generation sequencing (NGS) and genomic data analysis, I focus on bridging data science, bioinformatics, and genomics to develop innovative solutions for improving diagnostics, treatment strategies, and public health outcomes. My contributions underscore the transformative potential of bioinformatics in addressing complex biological systems and translating genomic insights into strategies that enhance global health.

Currently, I contribute to global health initiatives at the <a href="https://www.broadinstitute.org/">Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard</a>, building on my extensive experience in developing bioinformatics frameworks for infectious disease surveillance. My work encompasses AMR, genomics, and infectious disease surveillance, with a strong focus on fostering equitable solutions for LMICs. Previously, I collaborated with global organizations such as Africa CDC to implement genomic surveillance programs that enhance disease detection and response systems across Africa.

Passionate about translating research into actionable public health outcomes, I actively support Genomics, Bioinformatics, and Data Science programs at the <a href="https://ace.ac.ug/">African Center of Excellence in Bioinformatics & Data-intensive Sciences (ACE)</a> and <a href="https://chs.mak.ac.ug/team/gerald-mboowa" target="_blank">Makerere University</a>.
