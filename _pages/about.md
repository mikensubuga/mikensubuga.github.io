Hi! I am a PhD student at the University of Bristol and a part-time Data Scientist at both the [Jean Golding Institute](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/golding/), UK and [Infectious Diseases Institute's ACE](https://ace.ac.ug/), Uganda. My PhD is funded by the Medical Research Council(MRC) under GW4 BioMed2 MRC DTP under the Population Health theme. My project under the supervision of [Prof Kristen Reyher](https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/persons/kristen-k-reyher), [Dr. Sion Bayliss](https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/persons/sion-c-bayliss), [Prof Andrew Dowsey](https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/persons/andrew-dowsey), and [Dr. Lauren Cowley](https://researchportal.bath.ac.uk/en/persons/lauren-cowley) centers on collaborating with the UK Health Security Agency(UKHSA) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention(CDC) to develop cutting-edge machine learning tools aimed at forecasting outbreaks of foodborne diseases, while also identifying the genomic mechanisms of antimicrobial resistance (AMR).  These tools are used to support public health decision-making and facilitate rapid response to future outbreaks.

I previously did an MSc in Bioinformatics supported by the Fogarty International Center(FIC) of the National Institutes of Health(NIH) under the EANBIT project at Makerere University where my research focussed on evaluating the practicality and broader adaptability of machine learning models, particularly in the realm of identifying antimicrobial resistance within low-middle-income countries(LMICs).

I enjoy contributing to innovations in global health and education. My work spans AMR, genomics, infectious diseases, and education initiatives, with a particular focus on LMICs
